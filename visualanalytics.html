<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><u><underline></u> BIO.</p>
<p><center>A computer science PHd student at NC A&T.My area of interest is in visual analytics.Currently working on web visual analytics.
Prior experiences includes biosythetic pathway visualization maps research and US ARMY veteran.Did several tours abroad.
During missions gathered valuable skills which I Plan on using to revolutionalizing science by use of computing to solve daily challenges that emerge in society.
  Love working with people and making friends. </center></p>

<p>Chapter 1 motivates the topic of visual analytics and presents a brief history of the domain.
Chapter 2 deals with the basis of visual analytics including its current application areas, the visual analytics process,
 its building blocks, and its inherent scientiﬁc challenges.informationVisual analytics aims at making data and 
 information processing transparent.Visual analytics aims to - Synthesise information and derive insight from massive, 
 dynamic, ambiguous, and often conﬂicting data. - Detect the expected and discover the unexpected. 
 - Provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments. - Communicate these assessment eﬀectively for action
 The visual analytics process is characterised through interaction between data, visualisations, 
 models about the data, and the users in order to discover knowledge<p>
<p>
 Chapter 3 reviews the ﬁeld of data management with respect to visual analyticsGiuseppe Santucci Helwig Hauser
 and reviews current database technology. It then summarises the problems that can arise when dealing with large, 
 complex and heterogeneous datasets or data streams. A scenario is given, which illustrates tight integration of data management and visual analytics.
 The state of the art section also considers techniques for the integration of data and issues relating to data reduction, including visual data 
 reduction techniques and the related topic of visual quality metrics. The challenges section identiﬁes important issues, such as dealing with 
 uncertainties in the data and the integrity of the results, the management of semantics (i.e., data which adds meaning to the data values), 
 the emerging area of data streaming, interactive visualisation of large databases and database issues concerning distributed and collaborative visual analytics. <p>
